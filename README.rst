Banjax
======

Crowd-transcription and output interfaces for crazed loons (it's literally the bollox)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About
-----
Based on our experience cobbling together multiple systems, languages and data formats for the Letters of 1916 project, we thought it would be better to create a nifty, modular, single-data-format system (eXist-DB!!). This is the home page. For now.

Proposed modules
----------------
	- banjax-tint (a transcription interface that's XML-free, relying on clever drag'n'drop <div> elements)
	- banjax-mint (a metadata input interface, based on a weird, declarative, embeddable XML vocabulary to map input fields to TEI elements)
	- banjax-some-other-stuff-that-will-become-apparent-at-a-later-date
	- CHECK OUT <a href="FEATURES.markdown">features</a> for proposed features.

Languages
---------
	- XQuery (in eXist) for data management
	- Python (Tornado) web framework for all sorts of concurrent, asynchronous stuff.
	- JavaScript
	- some other things.
